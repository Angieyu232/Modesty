# Modesty

## Purpose of this web app

In an age of information overload, weâ€™re inundated with social media and ceaseless
flow of news with questionable contents. In Modesty web app, users can take
control over the sources of media contents as well as how much time they want to
spent on it. To achieve better balance between living in seclusion and plugging in
social networks for hours, my app will let users to input their choice of media
outlets and social accounts that they genuinely want to follow. By having users set
their own daily time limit, I hope users can regain a sense of agency around the
matter of media consumption.
